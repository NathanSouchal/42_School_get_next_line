# ðŸ“„ get_next_line

`get_next_line` is a 42 School project whose objective is to implement a function that reads from a file descriptor, returning one line at a time, including the newline character (`\n`). It must handle reading efficiently using a buffer and manage memory correctly between calls.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to master:

- Reading from file descriptors (`read`)
- Efficient buffer handling
- Persistent state between function calls (static variables)
- Memory allocation & leak prevention
- Handling multiple file descriptors at once
